Two phase distortion oscillators using the same principles as the [cz synths of the 80s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_distortion_synthesis).

One is so simple that *itCz to use it* !

The other one let you control all the oscillator's parameters and enjoy the *Knigh Rider* LEDs. You have to *see see* it !

Note that these modules are monophonic.
